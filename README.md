# Regular Expressions

These exercises are designed for you to practice writing regular expressions and using them in Java via String methods and the Regex API.

Please read the instructions for each exercise carefully.

Your solutions will be automatically evaluated via the unit tests defined in [`src/test/java`](src/test/java).

- [Exercise 1: Validator](src/main/java/ex1)
- [Exercise 2: Cleaner](src/main/java/ex2)
- [Exercise 3: Finder](src/main/java/ex3)
- [Exercise 4: Parser](src/main/java/ex4) 

TIP: Before writing your Java code, write your regular expressions in a platform like https://regex101.com/ and https://regexr.com/. You can use the examples in the files available in  [`src/test/resources`](src/test/resources) to test them.
