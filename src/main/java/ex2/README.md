## Exercise 2: Cleaner

Implement, using regular expressions, the two cleaning methods of the [`Cleaner`](Cleaner.java) class. These methods return copies of an input string without certain elements.

  - `String cleanHtml(String html)`
  - `String cleanDuplicates(String text)`

Read the description of each method and its associated tests for details on its expected behavior.

Your code should pass all tests defined in [`HtmlCleanerTest`](../../../test/java/ex2/HtmlCleanerTest.java) and [`DuplicateCleanerTest`](../../../test/java/ex2/DuplicateCleanerTest.java).
